    1)-  ############ Higer Order Component ################

    ==> Now In this episode we will talk about,
       HOW TO MANAGE DATA INSIDE OUR REACT APPLICATION?


    ==> Higer order component is a function that takes a component { inside } and returns a component. that is a 
        "Higer Order Component".
    ==> It is just a normal javascript function. 

    ### why do we use it?
    ## what component does it take?
    ### and what component did it returns? 

    ==> So higer order components basically takes a component as an input and then it inhences that components, it adds some extra feature to that component and returns it back. It acts like a inhencer kind of function, it takes an existing component, that is an existing component and just inhences it, it just modifies that component, it twiks a little and returns it back that is known as {"Higer Order Component"}.

    ==> we will devlop a feature that will be using a higer order component. and then it will be very much clear to you

    ==> so over here there are many restuarant but if you will see out of these restaurant, some of these restaurant are { promoted}, there are many pramoted restuarant ,the card is very similar, the only differnce is 
    this { promoted } level on the top, so what we are going to create, we are going to create this feature, this 
    { promoted } level on the restaurant cards ?

    ==> so what we are going to do is, we are going to create this feature of this { pramoted } level on your restaurant cards? this is the feature 

    ==> so what we are going to write the code for 
    
    ==> so what we will do, we will take a existing card, we have already built this card, but according to the data, what we will do is, we will just take this card, we will write a { higer Order Componnent }, we will write a function that will take this card and it will split out a new card that will have { pramoted level } on top of it. so that function that will do our job is known as { "Higer Order Component" }.

    ==> how will i get to know which restaurant is prapomoted and which restaurnt is not ?
       
       ################################## Let's create card  ######################################

    ==> Let me create a higer order function that will give us a card with a promoted label.

    ==> so we have this restaurantCard , we want another restaurantCard that is the inhanced version of this 
        restaurant card but it has a promoted label on top of it.   ---- in akshay case

     ==> so we have this restaurantCard , we want another restaurantCard that is the inhenced version of this 
        restaurant card but it has a promoted label on top of it.    ----- in my case

    ==> So for that we will create a higer order component. we will take this RestaurantCard as an input, and it will return me a new component which is a inhenced restaurantCard

    ==> when i say Inhenced restaurantCard that means restaurantCard with promoted level. and it will return me a new component which is a Inhenced restaurantCard
