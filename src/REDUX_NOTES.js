 # Redux Toolkit

 ==> Install @redux.js/toolkit and react-redux

==> Build our store

==> Connect our store to our app

==> Slice {cartSlice}
  --> we will create a slice to add the items to the carts
  --> dispatch an action 

  ==> dispatch (action)

  ==> Selector

  --> we will dispatch an action, when we click on that add button, we dispatch an action 
  --> we also read the data using selector 








 we are going to study redux

 ==> In this, we are going to see, how we can manage state of our application using REDUX.

 ==> how we can manage data of our application using REDUX, 

 ==> there is data layer and the UI layer.

 ==> REDUX works in the data layer of our application.

 ==> UI and data layer works in sink , builds our own react app.

 ==> how we can handle data using redux effectively 

 ==> When you are building a small application Or Even a mid-sized application, you dont need redux but if you 
     are building large scale application where the data is heavely used, where a lot of read and write operation
     are happening in you UI application, In your react application, there are lot of components, a lot of data is
     being trasfered between these components. The application has grown huge then using redux make sense.

==> but if you are building a small app, If you are building a very small app with few components, then you
  don't need redux.

  ==> All the application which are built using redux, can be built without using redux also.

  ==> Redux is not mandatory use it, when it is required 


  ==> React and Redux are different libraries.
